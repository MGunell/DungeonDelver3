class Selected
{
	//this class will allow the system to store a selection, 
	//as well as a currently selected texture, which we can then
	//apply directly to our screen based on a for looped set * increment
	//most likely this means we need to write to a textFile named
	//the level, as well as specify a level size.
	//we can do X*x and then spawn a row of 0's 
	//the mouse class will monitor it's position as a camera
	//which we will track vs the level sizes grid doing matrix subtraction
	//on a matrix of {M0...Mn1, N0...Nn} : n1 = X, n2 = x;
	//and m(n1) = 
	//or we can just hold the level's top left (x,y)
	//as well as the mouse (x,y) separately.
	//if mouse == (0,0) at spawn if we move mouse down the window (0,-200)
	//then mousepPs = 
	//(origen(0,0) - (0, (-200/scale_size_y((window_height/number_of_grids(10))
	//the reason for this is so we can move out of bounds of the level editor by default
	// we can say that if pos of grid# > X then grids id is 0xFFFFFF
	// otherwise id is NULL, until assigned otherwise
	// as we move the mouse around, it tracks the current grid number, 
	//which is also the levels (-x,-y)+mousePos() the origin should also normally be
	//(0,0) + levels(-x,-y) and that will be where we spawn the levels position
	//in relation to
	//so as we click we assign a value inside the text file where the cursor
	//iterates n rows and n columns down, leading to directly on the id at that
	//digit and changing it to the mouses currently selected id.
	//on each loop through the program we render that grid which is being manipulated
	//on heap/stack and not being read through each loop.
	//when we save we rewrite the rext document.
	//sounds easy lets implement it.

	//so that  we multiply a {1x1} matrix that is a value for 
	//case e turn things on the {x, y} values only, and is such that
